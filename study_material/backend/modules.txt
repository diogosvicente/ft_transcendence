by introducing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and utilizing JSON Web Tokens
(JWT). Key features and objectives include:
◦ Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) as an additional layer of security
for user accounts, requiring users to provide a secondary verification method,
such as a one-time code, in addition to their password.
◦ Utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT) as a secure method for authentication and
authorization, ensuring that user sessions and access to resources are managed
securely.
◦ Provide a user-friendly setup process for enabling 2FA, with options for SMS
codes, authenticator apps, or email-based verification.
◦ Ensure that JWT tokens are issued and validated securely to prevent unauthorized
access to user accounts and sensitive data.
This major module aims to strengthen user account security by offering Two-Factor
Authentication (2FA) and enhancing authentication and authorization through the
use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
